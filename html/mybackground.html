        <h3>My Background</h3>
        <p>	I am currently employed as a Cloud Services Engineer for a global physical security company and am a fully certified remote enterpise support specialist. I am certified in several  access control, network video surveillance and intrusion prevention systems.
        I  have a Masters of Science in Information Technology from the University of Cincinnati and a Bachelors of Science in Chemistry from Governors State University. I have extensive art and design studio education from the Herron School of Art at Indiana University, The Art Academy University - San Fransisco and the Art Institute of Pittsburgh. 
        I currently study Full Stack Engineering, Python, C++ and Game Asset Development in Unreal Engine.
        I have a great interest and enthusiasm for web applications and API Integrations, website developments, 3D cinematics / gaming, and home automation applications.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>	I supplement my time by developing gaming, visual assets, and effects in Unreal Game Engine using Blue Prints and C++.
        I also study 3D Modeling in Blender and Z-Brush Software. 
        I have begun designing physical home automation appliances in Fusin 360 for application with IoT. These applications utilize the  Home Assistant Platform and original Python Code. The systems are build off of Raspberry Pi technology.
        I still study formal studio art pursuits. My primary media are pastels and I do some sculpture in Limestone and Alabaster as well.</p>
        <h3>Personal Details</h3>
        <p>I am 52 years old and was raised near Chicago Illinois and reside in Indianapolis, Indiana. I am divorced with one adult autistic child.  I am Roman Catholic and support both NAMI and Autism Speaks Charities.</p>
